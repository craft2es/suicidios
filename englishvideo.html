          <p class="text"> <span class="dropcap">A</span> ccording to the latest survey from the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2015, 13.2 percent of adolescent Latinas attempted suicide in New York City, the highest percentage of any racial group in the same age range. </p>

          <p class="text"> The same study shows that in 2015, 15.1 percent of adolescent Latinas across the United States attempted suicide. These statistics are alarming given that the numbers are mucher higher compared to all other non-Latino communities. </p>

          <p class="text">Jennifer Humensky, a professor at Columbia University in the psychiatry department who has studied the issue, explained that this has been a consistent problem since the 1990s. Adolescent Latinas who live in poverty face the same risk factors as their non-latino counterparts. However, some specific factors in the Latino community have to do with a clash of cultures.</p>

          <p class="text"> “Aside from facing all the risks that people who live in poverty face, there are some unique risk factors specific to the Latino community and one is cultural dissonance between the culture of origin and the culture the person is exposed to in the United States,” she said. “This can lead to personal conflicts and conflicts with other members of the family.”</p>

          <p class="text"> In Latino cultures, according to Humensky, there is a large focus on the family, the importance of authority and traditional gender roles. The conflicts present themselves when girls are exposed to American culture in school, where is there is a focus on independence. Humensky also said that according to the research, adolescent Latinas with a better dominance of English face a larger conflict between two cultures. This often means a higher risk of suicidal ideation. She and her research team have found that family instability, challenges in the migration process and the parents’ mental health are also contributing risk factors. </p>
